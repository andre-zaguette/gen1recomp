# Wilds of Kanto

Wilds of Kanto brings visible and reactive wild Pokemon into the overworld of
[Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp).

Instead of every encounter existing only behind a random battle transition,
wild Pokemon can appear directly in encounter areas, stand in tall grass,
wander around, react to the player, or remain hidden as movement in the grass.

The goal is not to replace the original Gen 1 identity. It is to add a version
of the overworld I used to imagine when playing these games as a child.

> Brings visible and reactive wild Pokemon into the Gen 1 overworld, with
> roaming, hidden and aggressive encounters across grass, caves and other
> supported areas.

## Choose Your Overworld Sprite Style

Wilds of Kanto lets you choose which overworld Pokémon sprites you prefer
without changing the spawn or encounter system.

Available styles:

- **HGSS / PokeMMO** (default) — uses the animated sprite sheets bundled with
  Wilds of Kanto.
- **Poke Followers** — uses compatible walker sprites supplied through
  **Followers EX / PokePC Followers** when those mods are installed. Falls back
  to HGSS / PokeMMO when the follower provider is unavailable.
- **Pokedex** — uses the original Pokédex-based images.

You can switch styles at any time from Wilds of Kanto **Mod Settings**.
Existing wild Pokémon and your active Followers EX follower update immediately
without being respawned.

**Spawn Amount**, **Random Enc**, **Water Mons**, **Dev Overlay**, and
**Test Spawn** live in Mod Settings together with Sprite Style. The normal
Start / Pause menu is no longer filled with Wilds quick settings.

External sprite styles require their corresponding mods to be installed
separately. Wilds of Kanto does not redistribute their assets.

### Optional Sprite Mods

To use **Poke Followers**, install the corresponding mods through the
Gen1Recomp Mod Manager or from their official GitHub releases:

- [Followers EX](https://github.com/masterwebx/gen1recomp-followers-ex)
  (`FOLLOWERS_EX`)
- [PokePC Followers](https://github.com/gamecorner-033/PokePCFollowers)
  (`PokePCFollowers_VoxelMerge`), required by Followers EX

After installation, restart Gen1Recomp and select the style from:

```text
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Sprite Style
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Spawn Amount
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Random Enc
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Water Mons
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Dev Overlay
MOD SETTINGS -> WILDS OF KANTO -> Test Spawn (OPEN)
```

Default Sprite Style is always **HGSS / PokeMMO** (built-in) and does not
depend on which companion mods are installed.

## Sprite Pack Shoutouts

A big shoutout to the creators who made the different overworld styles
available to the community:

- **OtaconRevengeance** — creator of the
  [Gold Sprites](https://github.com/OtaconRevengeance/gold_sprites) mod.
- **masterwebx** — creator of
  [Followers EX](https://github.com/masterwebx/gen1recomp-followers-ex).
- **gamecorner-033** — creator/maintainer of
  [PokePC Followers](https://github.com/gamecorner-033/PokePCFollowers)
  (walker sheet provider used by Followers EX; overworld art credited there to
  ShockSlayer / Pokémon Crystal Clear).
- **DramaticShape** — Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod compatibility work that keeps
  native SpriteRenderer sheets working in orbit / first-person views.

Wilds of Kanto only integrates with externally installed sprite mods. Their
assets remain owned and licensed by their respective creators.

## Sprite Styles (technical)

Wilds of Kanto exposes three public overworld sprite styles:

- **HGSS / PokeMMO** (`pokemmo`) — built-in animated overworld sprites (default).
- **Poke Followers** (`followers`) — visible setting value; resolves through the
  internal `followers_ex` provider, then falls back to HGSS / PokeMMO.
- **Pokedex** (`pokedex`) — original Pokédex-based images.

All styles use the same native Gen1Recomp SpriteRenderer pipeline and remain
compatible with Dramatic Shape, including first-person rendering and world
occlusion.

The **HGSS / PokeMMO** label refers to Wilds of Kanto’s own runtime follow-sprite
sheets (`assets/generated/followsprites_runtime/`). It does not ship or claim
Followers EX / PokePC assets.

Optional companion mods (runtime detection only — **no hard dependencies**):

- [Followers EX](https://github.com/masterwebx/gen1recomp-followers-ex)
  (`FOLLOWERS_EX`) — control / pack integration; depends on Wilds and the
  PokePC sprite pack.
- PokePC Followers Voxel Merge (`PokePCFollowers_VoxelMerge`) — walker sheet
  assets used by Followers EX.

Companion mods can also register a provider at runtime:

```lua
wilds.exports.registerSpriteProvider("followers_ex", provider)
```

## Animated Overworld Pokémon

Wilds of Kanto uses individual follow-sprite sheets as its preferred
animated overworld sprite source (the **PokeMMO** style above).

Each supported Pokémon can use:

- directional idle sprites for down, left, right, and up;
- directional walking sprites for down, left, right, and up;
- visible idle direction changes while looking around;
- walking animations while wandering or chasing the player.

The sprites are matched exclusively by Pokédex / species ID, so the system
remains independent of the selected game language.

Normal and shiny sprite variants are supported by the asset format. Shiny
sprites are only used during normal gameplay when the game provides a reliable
shiny state. They remain available in the developer preview for testing.

Choose **Sprite Style** in Wilds of Kanto Mod Settings (HGSS / PokeMMO /
Poke Followers / Pokedex). HGSS / PokeMMO is the default. The same style is
applied to your active Followers EX follower.

If a follow sprite or mapping is missing, the mod automatically falls back to:

1. the next provider in the style chain (see Sprite Styles);
2. the previous Pokédex-based sprite;
3. the black fallback sprite.

Follow-sprites work in both the normal 2D overworld path and with Dramatic
Shape. Idle look, wander, and aggressive chase behaviour keep the same logic as
before; hidden grass encounters still show no Pokémon sprite. Species above 151
may already exist in the mapping for later use, but Gen 1 gameplay only spawns
species the current game actually supports.

## What it does

On maps with wild encounter data, the mod reads Gen1Recomp’s imported encounter
tables and places tangible wild Pokemon (or hidden markers) on eligible tiles.

- Species and levels come from the real encounter table for the current map
- Spawns work without the Pokédex — Route 1 before Oak’s parcel is fine
- Spawn density scales with encounter-area size; larger routes can hold more
  active Pokemon, distributed across connected regions
- Tall-grass presentation: option for fully above grass or partially immersed
  (engine `drawCellBottom` feet overdraw, like the player)
- Small species get nearest-neighbor sprite scaling so they stay readable
- Real Pokemon art is preferred; **Sprite Style** selects HGSS / PokeMMO,
  Poke Followers, or legacy Pokedex images (HGSS / PokeMMO by default)
- Otherwise legacy species / battle PNGs are used; a black fallback sprite is
  used when no image resolves (hidden behaviours draw no Pokemon sprite)
- Vanilla random grass encounters remain as a fail-safe until the visible
  system is ready; they can stay suppressed afterward via options
- Story progress, player position, and warps are never modified

## Encounter behaviors

### Idle

Stays in place, glances a new direction every few seconds. Walking into it can
start a wild battle with that exact species and level.

### Wander

Moves randomly inside its connected encounter region (grass, cave walkables, or
water). Contact can start a battle.

### Aggressive

Has a facing sight line. When it spots the player it shows an exclamation mark
(`!`), then chases — and may leave tall grass after alerting. Contact after the
alert starts an unavoidable battle. Sight is blocked by non-walkable tiles.
Aggressive chase uses the same tile-step movement style as NPCs and is safe for
optional Dramatic Shape Voxel presentation (the `!` is the engine emote, not a
second Pokemon entity).

### Hidden

Shows no Pokemon sprite. On grass, the tile shakes; in caves, a dust/shadow
marker is used instead. Stepping onto the tile starts the encounter.

## Safari Pokémon Behaviour

Visible Pokémon inside an active Safari Zone session never start normal
battles.

Some Safari Pokémon may notice the player, show an alert icon, and run a few
tiles away before returning to idle or wandering behaviour. Catching them still
uses the game's native Safari encounter system with Safari Balls, bait, rocks,
and the normal flee mechanics.

This overworld behaviour only affects movement and does not change Safari catch
or flee rates.

During an active Safari session, classic step encounters stay off so you can
approach visible Pokémon without a random interruption. Outside the Safari Zone,
behaviour and Random Enc are unchanged. If the native Safari battle path is
unavailable, visible Safari spawns are disabled and Vanilla Safari is left alone.

## Random Encounters

Classic step-based random encounters can be enabled or disabled from Wilds of
Kanto Mod Settings (**Random Enc**).

Disabling random encounters does not remove visible overworld Pokémon. Wild
Pokémon can still appear in the world and start battles through direct
interaction or their normal behaviour.

**Spawn Amount** and **Water Mons** are also Mod Settings. With the default
**Swim Sprites** mode, visible water Pokémon remain active even when Random Enc
is off. Classic surf / fishing rolls follow Random Enc, except when Water Mons
is set to **Classic Enc** (water rolls stay on) or **Disabled** (water rolls
off).

## Visible Water Pokémon

**Water Mons** chooses how water Pokémon appear:

| Mode | Visible water mons | Water / fishing RNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swim Sprites (default) | Full Swimming / Levitates sprites | Follows Random Enc |
| Hid Silhouette | Small dark circle on the surface | Follows Random Enc |
| Silhouettes | Dark blue-teal silhouette of the active sprite style | Follows Random Enc |
| Classic Enc | None | Always on (even if Random Enc is off) |
| Disabled | None | Always off |

In Swim Sprites / Hid Silhouette / Silhouettes, suitable Pokémon from the
current map's water encounter table appear on connected water and keep
`WATER_IDLE` / `WATER_WANDER` / `WATER_AGGRESSIVE`. Legacy hidden grass/cave
markers remain optional via Hidden Mons.

### Voxel Water Presentation

- **Hidden Silhouettes** use a generic flat underwater shadow marker
  (`assets/generated/water_hidden_runtime/hidden-water-shadow.png`).
- **Silhouettes** use the actual dark Pokémon shape as a flat underwater
  shadow (native pre-rendered silhouette sheets + local flat world transform).
- **Flat 2D** presentation remains unchanged (dark circle / tinted sprite).

## Cave Spawns

- **Reachable Only** keeps visible cave Pokémon on areas the player can
  actually enter.
- **Mixed** keeps most Pokémon on reachable paths, while allowing a small
  number of atmospheric Pokémon in inaccessible cave sections.

Scenery Pokémon cannot attack the player through walls or start encounters
from unreachable areas.

## Water Spawn Variety

Visible water Pokémon are selected from the current area's Surf and fishing encounter tables.

- Pokémon obtainable with basic fishing methods can appear closer to shore.
- Stronger Pokémon that normally require the Super Rod only appear in deeper water farther away from land.
- Small ponds without deep-water areas do not spawn Super-Rod-only Pokémon.

Some water Pokémon can be aggressive and swim toward the player while remaining on water.

Aggressive land Pokémon may also follow the player into nearby water when a compatible Swimming or Levitates sprite exists. Once in the water, they remain there and do not chase the player back onto land.

## World Collision

Visible wild Pokémon reserve both their current tile and movement target.
They cannot spawn on top of another entity, walk through Pokémon, trainers,
NPCs, or an active follower, or swap tiles during simultaneous movement.

## Follower Water Sprites

When a compatible follower mod is active, a follower can use Wilds of Kanto's
Swimming or Levitates sprite while the player is surfing. Wilds only supplies
the sprite definition; follower ownership and movement remain with the follower
mod.

## Land-to-Water Chase

Aggressive land Pokémon with a compatible Swimming or Levitates sprite can
follow the player into an unoccupied water tile. The same entity switches to
its water sprite without respawning.

## Water Pokémon Sprites

Visible Pokémon on water use dedicated animated water sprites whenever
available.

Wilds of Kanto supports two built-in water sprite types:

- **Swimming** — used when a dedicated swimming animation exists.
- **Levitates** — used when a Pokémon has a levitating or flying water
  animation.

Water sprites use the same directional idle and movement animation system as
the normal PokeMMO-style overworld sprites.

If the currently selected external sprite style does not provide a compatible
water sprite, Wilds of Kanto automatically uses its built-in Swimming or
Levitates sprite. If neither exists for that species, the normal built-in
PokeMMO sprite is used as a fallback.

Normal and shiny variants are selected from the actual Pokémon state.

Water sprites are matched by Pokédex / species ID (never localized names).
Changing Sprite Style does not replace land art with water art — only the water
surface state uses the water override. Rendering stays on the native
`SpriteRenderer` path, so Dramatic Shape orbit and first-person views remain
supported.

## Features

- Visible wild Pokemon in supported overworld encounter areas
- Behaviours: Idle, Wander, Aggressive, Hidden markers, Water Idle/Wander/Aggressive
- Safari Zone: native Safari encounters, Safari Idle/Wander/Flee (no normal aggro)
- Random Enc toggle for classic step-based encounters (default ON)
- Visible Water Mons from Surf + fishing encounter pools (toggleable, decentered density)
- Shore-distance water spawn zones (near / mid / deep)
- Cave spawns / movement limited to player-reachable cells
- Short spawn animations for visible grass and water Pokémon
- Map-aware spawn density and connected spawn regions
- Grass, cave (no grass graphics required), and Surf-water surfaces
- Visible water variety uses map Surf and rod tables (not a global type list)
- Selected Sprite Style applied to the active Followers EX follower (land + water)
- Sprite scaling: legacy art is capped to one map tile; follow-sprite frames
  keep native tile size with feet anchored to the tile
- Engine tall-grass overlay with relative occlusion; Dramatic Shape uses
  world billboards so bushes/walls occlude Pokemon like trainers
- Fallback chain: follow-sprite → legacy PNG → black fallback
- Dev Overlay (behaviour + facing labels) and Test Spawn selector
- Optional coexistence with [Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod)
  (not required); wild Pokemon use native `SpriteRenderer` sheets (trainer contract) and
  cached 16×16 billboard cards so DS depth/grass/occlusion match trainers;
  emergency 2D overlay only if the adapter bind fails
- Vanilla grass encounter fallback when the spawn system is not ready

## Compatibility and testing status

The current version has been tested primarily with Pokemon Blue.

The implementation uses Gen1Recomp’s imported encounter and map data rather
than Blue-specific hard-coded tables, so it is intended to work with the other
supported Gen 1 games as well. However, Red and Yellow have not yet received
the same amount of hands-on testing.

I also have not completed a full start-to-finish playthrough with the mod
enabled. The core systems are working, but unusual maps, scripted sequences or
late-game areas may still reveal edge cases.

Bug reports are especially helpful when they include the ROM version, map name,
screenshot and relevant debug log.

### Water

Surf / water encounter tables and the area's Old / Good / Super Rod fishing
pools can produce visible water Pokemon when **Water Mons** is ON. Spawns are
placed by shore distance (near / mid / deep). Super-Rod-only species appear
only in deep water. They stay on connected water (`WATER_IDLE` /
`WATER_WANDER` / `WATER_AGGRESSIVE`). Vanilla Surf / fishing random encounters
remain controlled by **Random Enc**. Aggressive water Pokémon chase only while
the player is surfing; they never leave the water. Compatible aggressive land
Pokémon may follow the player into nearby water when a Swimming or Levitates
sprite exists, then stay on water.

### Caves

Cave / indoor wild maps do not require visible grass tiles. Eligible spawn
tiles are walkable non-warp indoor cells (Gen1Recomp’s indoor encounter rule).
Hidden encounters use a dust/shadow effect instead of grass shake. Individual
caves may still need additional testing.

## Installation

1. Install [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp)
2. Import your own legally obtained Gen 1 ROM supported by Gen1Recomp
3. Download a Wilds of Kanto release ZIP (`wilds-of-kanto-v*.zip`)
4. Open Gen1Recomp → Mod Manager (F10) → Import the ZIP
5. Enable **Wilds of Kanto**
6. Reload the map / continue play if you were already in the overworld
7. Adjust options in the Mod Manager as you like

The ZIP root must contain `manifest.json` directly (no wrapping folder).
Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod is optional and not required.

This project does not include a ROM.

## Options

All options are live (`mod.options_changed`); no restart is required.
Visible labels are limited to 14 characters so Gen1Recomp does not truncate them.

Gameplay settings live exclusively in **Mod Settings** (not duplicated in the
Start / Pause menu).

| Label | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Show Wild Mons | Master switch for visible spawns | ON |
| Sprite Style | HGSS / PokeMMO / Poke Followers / Pokedex (also applied to your active follower) | HGSS / POKEMMO |
| Spawn Amount | Density preset (Low / Normal / High / Very High); also scales visible water Pokémon | NORMAL |
| Random Enc | Classic step-based random encounters (grass / cave / water). Visible overworld Pokémon stay active. | ON |
| Water Mons | Swim Sprites (default) / Hid Silhouette / Silhouettes / Classic Enc / Disabled | SWIM SPRITES |
| Cave Spawns | Reachable Only (default) / Mixed (~20% scenery) | REACHABLE ONLY |
| Grass View | Immersed in tall grass, or fully Above | IMMERSED |
| Idle Mons | Allow Idle Look behaviour | ON |
| Roam Mons | Allow wandering inside encounter regions | ON |
| Chase Mons | Allow aggressive spot / chase behaviour | ON |
| Hidden Mons | Allow hidden grass / cave markers | ON |
| Dev Overlay | Compact behaviour + facing label above each wild Pokémon | OFF |

**Test Spawn** opens a Pokémon list (OPTIONS activate row / Mod Settings hook)
and spawns the selected species on a free tile next to the player. It respects
cell occupancy and uses the current Sprite Style.

Cave spawns and cave movement are limited to cells the player can actually
reach (BFS from the player start cell). Visible water Pokémon are distributed
more sparsely than earlier builds, with Manhattan spacing scaled by Spawn Amount.

Fine-tuning that used to appear in older builds (hard caps, refill interval,
sprite opacity, legacy aliases, strict billboard probes, and the old multi-toggle
developer panel) is no longer in the public menu. Runtime defaults remain in code.
Internal diagnostics may still appear while Dev Overlay is on.

## Updates

Wilds of Kanto supports update detection through the Gen1Recomp Mod Manager.

Install the mod through the manager or import the official GitHub release ZIP.
When a newer GitHub release is available, the Mod Manager can display and
install the update.

Official repository / releases:
[YoDrehDenSwagAuf/overworld-spawn-mod](https://github.com/YoDrehDenSwagAuf/overworld-spawn-mod/releases)

## Dev Overlay & Test Spawn

**Dev Overlay** is optional and not needed for normal play. When enabled it:

- Draws a compact behaviour + facing label above each visible wild Pokémon
  (for example `AGGRO · LEFT` or `WATER IDLE` / `← LEFT`)
- May also show the detailed diagnostics HUD (cave reachability, water target /
  spacing, follower style status, and related spawn info)

**Test Spawn** opens a Pokémon list so you can spawn a species on a free
neighbour tile for testing. Occupancy is respected; if no free tile exists you
get `No free spawn tile`. Test Spawn is available as its own Mod Settings /
OPTIONS activate row and does not require Dev Overlay.

Please include Dev Overlay HUD details or log lines when filing bug reports.
## Why I made this

I have always loved the original Pokemon games, and Gen1Recomp immediately
felt like a special project. Seeing those games rebuilt as a native LÖVE2D
experience, with a real modding platform on top, made me want to contribute
something of my own.

The Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod pushed that feeling even further. It showed how
much new atmosphere could be added without losing the identity of the
original games.

When I played Pokemon as a child, I often imagined that the creatures were
actually present in the routes around me: hiding in the grass, moving between
tiles, or noticing the player before a battle began. Wilds of Kanto is my
attempt to turn a little of that imagined version into something playable.

I work as a software developer, but I am not a game developer. This is my
first game mod, and building it has been a genuinely fun learning experience.

## Related projects

Wilds of Kanto is an independent fan project. It is not part of Gen1Recomp and
not part of the Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod. It does not require the voxel mod.

- [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp)  
  The native LÖVE2D recreation and modding platform that makes this mod possible.

- [Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod)  
  An impressive presentation mod that turns the overworld into a 3D diorama and
  was a major source of inspiration for this project.

## Known limitations

- Tested primarily with Pokemon Blue; Red and Yellow need more hands-on checks
- No full start-to-finish playthrough with the mod enabled yet
- Unusual maps may still have odd encounter-area edge cases
- Sprite sizes are not always perfect because source art varies
- Some species may use the fallback sprite when no image resolves
- Water Idle / Wander / Aggressive are supported; classic Surf rolls follow Random Enc
- Cave maps may still need additional verification
- Aggressive chase uses tile steps and can struggle on complex layouts
- Followers EX has no public API for Wilds to inject blockers into follower
  pathfinding; Wilds still treats follower cells as occupied for its own spawns
  and steps
- Compatibility with other mods is not fully guaranteed
- Temporary overworld presentation often uses battle-front art scaled to 16×16
- Voxel billboards may not mirror custom 2D scale exactly

## Building from source

Requires a local Gen1Recomp checkout (provided by the bootstrap script) and
Python 3.

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh   # once — clones engine under .deps/ and links this mod
./scripts/build-mod.py
```

Output:

```text
dist/wilds-of-kanto-v1.0.2.zip          # public release name (upload this)
dist/overworld_wild_spawns-1.0.2.zip    # local technical-id alias
dist/overworld_wild_spawns.zip          # local unversioned alias
```

Tag a release with `v1.0.2` to run `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
publishes the public ZIP as a GitHub Release asset.
The archive root must contain the mod files directly:

```text
manifest.json
main.lua
options.lua
mod.card
assets/
lib/
docs/
…
```

Do not zip the whole git repository. `tests/`, `scripts/`, `.deps/`, and
`.git/` stay out of the package.

Headless validation (after bootstrap):

```sh
cd .deps/gen1recomp
luajit mods/overworld_wild_spawns/tests/overworld_wild_spawns_test.lua
python3 tools/modkit.py validate mods/overworld_wild_spawns
```

## Contributing and bug reports

Feedback and bug reports are welcome. When something looks wrong, please include:

- ROM version (Red / Blue / Yellow)
- Map name
- Whether a save was mid-story or a new game
- Screenshot if possible
- Relevant `[WildsOfKanto]` debug log lines (Dev Overlay helps)
